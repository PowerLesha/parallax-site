Parallax-style animated websit.

This is a responsive leaderboard UI built with React, Framer Motion, and TypeScript.

Features:

-Animated leaderboard rows - As you scroll, the table rows slide in one by one with smooth animations.

-Rocket launch effect - When the leaderboard becomes visible, a rocket launches off the screen. On mobile, the further you scroll, the higher it goes!

-Scroll-aware behavior - The app tracks your scroll direction to trigger animations only when needed.

-Expandable leaderboard â€“ You can expand the list to see more models, and hide it again. Only the new rows animate in/out.

-Animated UI elements - From the rocket flame to buttons and transitions, everything feels responsive and alive.

-Fully responsive - Works great on both desktop and mobile, adapting animations and layout automatically.
